# Trading Token

[Trading Token](http://mytradetoken.com/) provides peer to peer capital markets the next-generation in value exchange.  Seamless connection without a centralized authority.

## What is Trading Token?

We reinvented the digitized asset – making a secure, smart and easy-to-use tool to disrupt the way capital markets buy and sell crypto currency.  Trading Token is the next-generation of blockchain technology, smart contracts and distributed computing designed to capitalize on globalization.

Trading Token is an ERC-827 token easily purchased and sold on a number of exchanges. 

## Technology

Built on top of Ethereum,Trading Token uses smart contract technology to verify transactions cryptographically, ensuring the validity and security of all tokens exchanged between users.  Compared to a pure cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which uses blockchain technology to verify transactions of simple currency value, Ethereum’s concept of transaction verification was designed from the ground up to be extensible, allowing for the creation of more complicated storing and transactions of data without the need for a central authority. This allows Trading Token to be globally exchangeable, and transactions verifiable, without the need for a middleman.  Extensive information on the underlying technology can be found in the [Etherium white paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper).
