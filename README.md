# Trading Token

[Trading Token](http://mytradetoken.com/) provides peer to peer capital markets the next-generation in value exchange.  Seamless connection without a centralized authority.

## What is Trading Token?

We reinvented the digitized asset – making a secure, smart and easy-to-use tool to disrupt the way capital markets buy and sell crypto currency.  Trading Token is the next-generation of blockchain technology, smart contracts and distributed computing designed to capitalize on globalization.

Trading Token is an ERC-827 token easily purchased and sold on a number of exchanges. 

## Technology

With a secure, tamper-proof system that uses the Ethereum blockchain to verify transactions with cryptographic integrity, users can trade on our platform and bypass intermediaries in broker deals, transacting P2P (peer-to- peer) -- all of which will enhance ease of use and security for all parties alike, streamlining user experience and driving accelerated adoption. Compared to a pure cryptocurrency like Bitcoin -- which uses blockchain technology to verify transactions with a simple numeric value -- Ethereum's blockchain provides a built-in programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that securely transfer and store more complex forms of data. This allows Trading Token to be globally exchangeable, and transactions verifiable, without the need for a central authority. TRADE platform is being developed as an open source framework with respect to both P2P network and tokenized assets, which continues to operate and trade on the Ethereum network, independent of platform's contributors. TRADE provides a clean UI, utilizing EVM contracts under the hood. Additionally, ("TRADE") platform tokens may be traded on centralized digital asset exchanges as well.  Extensive information on the underlying technology can be found in the [TRADE whitepaper](https://github.com/mytradetoken/tradingtoken/blob/master/Whitepaper%20-%20TRADE.pdf).
